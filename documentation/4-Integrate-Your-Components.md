## 4. Integrate Your Components
IDS Testbed project ensures and facilitates integration of IDS connector into existing (eco)systems. 

The IDS Reference Testbed is a set up with Open Source IDS components which can be used to verify that a component:  

* implements the IDS specifications for establishing connections and communication.  

* and, thus, can work interoperable with all IDS components in the testbed setup.  


IDS-Testbed documentation includes

* An installation guide with instructions to install the testbed and each individual component
* An interconnectivity guide to connect the different components to one another
* A user guide that explains:
     * how you can connect the connector you have developed to the components of the testbed. 
     * how to get a certificate
     * how to register at the DAPS
     * etc
 
**(Work in progress)**
