# The International Data Spaces Association on GitHub

## SHARING DATA WHILE KEEPING DATA OWNERSHIP

The International Data Spaces Association aims at open, federated data ecosystems and marketplaces ensuring data sovereignty for the creator of the data.

Today, there is a common understanding that data is of high value. Leveraging this value and trading data creates huge revenues for the large data platform providers. Rarely, the creators of data are benefitting from this value in an adequate way. Often, only the cost for data creation and management remain with them. Furthermore, many give their data away for free or pay with it for the use of a service. Finally, others keep it for themselves without taking advantage of the value.

There is a need for vendor independent data ecosystems and marketplaces, open to all at low cost and with low entry barriers. This need is addressed by the International Data Spaces (IDS) Association, a nonprofit organization with today about 100 members from various industrial and scientific domains. The IDS Association specified an architecture, interfaces and sample code for an open, secure data ecosystem of trusted partners.

The specification of the IDS Association forms the basis for a data marketplace based on European values, i.e. data privacy and security, equal opportunities through a federated design, and ensuring data sovereignty for the creator of the data and trust among participants. It forms the strategic link between the creation of data in the internet of things on the one hand side and the use of this data in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms on the other hand side.
